#  Sunrise
## A photo blogging theme
* * * *
**[DEMO](http://john2x.com/wordpress)**
## Features: 
- Full background photos
- Simple and minimalist design
- Use Wordpress' "Featured Image" for your photos
- "Show/Hide Info" toggle for a better view of your photos
- Display thumbnails on homepage for better viewing **version 1.1.0**

## Limitations:
- Categories don't work (yet)
- **Opera** doesn't play too well with the full background image
- **Internet Explorer** doesn't support transparent backgrounds, so the text will fallback to a non-transparent background
- Comments are disabled (no plans on adding them later)

## Attribution:
This theme started from ["HTML5 Reset Wordpress Theme"](https://github.com/murtaugh/HTML5-Reset-Wordpress-Theme).

Using Eric Meyer's [reset.css](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/).

Background pattern from [Subtle Patterns](http://subtlepatterns.com/).
